iDRAC6 setup on an AMD 48 Magny Cours
=====================================

The DRAC (Dell Remote Access Control) is a second computer, physically
different of the main, powerfull computer.  Actually it is not even on
the same power supply than the main computer, so even if the Magny
Cours is not powered, the DRAC still runs.

This auxiliary computer is used to perform monitoring and remote management of
the main one and so, can avoid you to go upstairs to reboot it when it crashes.
You can also use it to control what happens from the POST to the boot process,
which can be usefull for, for instance, control what kernel select on GRUB.


Setting Up iDRAC6
-----------------

This document talks specifically about the iDRAC6 because it was the version
installed on the computers I was working on. The process should be more or
less the same with other versions.

First you need to have a physical access to the computer and to reboot it.
The step in the boot process should be as following:
1- the computer performs the POST
2- the computer initialize the iDRAC6
3- the computer ask you if you want to access configuration menus:
   - System Setup
   - BIOS Boot Configuration
   - PXE Boot
   - ...
4- the computer probe the hard drives
5- the computer ask you if you want to configure iDRAC6
6- the computer try to boot on several devices according the BIOS defined
   order

The first thing to do is to configure iDRAC6 at step 5. To do this,
the computer asks to type <Ctrl-E> or equivalent.  There is two
sections we are interrested in: the "IPMI Control" which you have to
enable, and the "Network IP Configuration" in which you have to
configure properly the IP Address, Netmask and Gateway.  Remember the
DRAC is a physically different computer so it have a separated network
interface, so make sure it is connected to the network and if you
choose static IP configuration, then set a different IP address than
the main computer.  For the Netmask and Gateway, the one used by the
main computer should be fine.

Before to validate changes, you also have to modify another section: the
"User Settings" to make sure you have a user configured with a password (be
carefull, the password you type is in qwerty).

Now you can continue the boot and check if the DRAC is correctly set up with
a web browser by connecting to the previously configured DRAC IP address.
If your configuration worked, you should see a web interface diplayed (slowly,
the auxiliary computer is not very powerfull) you can connect on by entering
the previoulsy given login/password.


Setting Up Serial Redirection
-----------------------------

By now, you should be able to do several things using the web interface.
For instance, you can control the power supply of the computer, and so, to
shutdown, boot or reboot the computer, even if its OS crashes.
However, you do not have any control on the boot process yet. For this you
have to enable the serial redirection. The main computer is able to redirect
the serial output to the DRAC which can remotely send it to you.

To enable this functionnality, you have, once again to access physically to
the computer to activate some options in the BIOS (or System Setup on my
computer).
Once you are on the right menu, you have to go in the submenu
"Serial Communication" and set the "Console Redirection" item to "On with
Console Redirection via COM2", set the "Baud rate" to 115200 and to disable
the "Redirection after Boot".

Now in the DRAC web interface, in the "iDRAC Parameters" section
"Network/Security" subsection "Serial", you need to activate the "IPMI Serial"
(or deactivate the "RAC serial") and set the baud rate to "115.2 kb/s".

Finally, you have to modify the GRUB configuration (or do equivalent changes in
yout bootloader) by writing in the "/etc/default/grub" file:
- add the following kernel option: "console=ttyS1,115200"
  > GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS1,115200"
- disable the graphical terminal by setting it to the serial console
  > GRUB_TERMINAL=serial
- specify the right baud rate for the serial terminal
  > GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --unit=1 --speed=115200"
Now you can update your grub config "grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg"

The setup is now done, to access the boot console, you can connect to the
DRAC IP by ssh (ssh root@<my DRAC IP>), you should access to a weird console
with a prompt like "/admin1>". You can now type "console com2" and after a
few seconds you have access to the serial console.
