iDRAC6 setup on an AMD 48 Magny Cours
=====================================

The DRAC (Dell Remote Access Control) is a second computer, physically
different of the main, powerfull computer.  Actually it is not even on
the same power supply than the main computer, so even if the Magny
Cours is not powered, the DRAC still runs.

This auxiliary computer is used to perform monitoring and remote management of
the main one and so, can avoid you to go upstairs to reboot it when it crashes.
You can also use it to control what happens from the POST to the boot process,
which can be usefull for, for instance, control what kernel select on GRUB.


Setting Up iDRAC6
-----------------

This document talks specifically about the iDRAC6 because it was the version
installed on the computers I was working on. The process should be more or
less the same with other versions.

First you need to have a physical access to the computer and to reboot it.
The step in the boot process should be as following:
1- the computer performs the POST
2- the computer initialize the iDRAC6
3- the computer ask you if you want to access configuration menus:
   - System Setup
   - BIOS Boot Configuration
   - PXE Boot
   - ...
4- the computer probe the hard drives
5- the computer ask you if you want to configure iDRAC6
6- the computer try to boot on several devices according the BIOS defined
   order

The first thing to do is to configure iDRAC6 at step 5. To do this,
the computer asks to type <Ctrl-E> or equivalent.  There is two
sections we are interrested in: the "IPMI Control" which you have to
enable, and the "Network IP Configuration" in which you have to
configure properly the IP Address, Netmask and Gateway.  Remember the
DRAC is a physically different computer so it have a separated network
interface, so make sure it is connected to the network and if you
choose static IP configuration, then set a different IP address than
the main computer.  For the Netmask and Gateway, the one used by the
main computer should be fine.

Before to validate changes, you also have to modify another section: the
"User Settings" to make sure you have a user configured with a password (be
carefull, the password you type is in qwerty).

Now you can continue the boot and check if the DRAC is correctly set up with
a web browser by connecting to the previously configured DRAC IP address.
If your configuration worked, you should see a web interface diplayed (slowly,
the auxiliary computer is not very powerfull) you can connect on by entering
the previoulsy given login/password.
